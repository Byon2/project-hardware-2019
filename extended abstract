1. Title of the project

Project: car race game(temporary)

Objective and Requirements

An object is placed at the end of the screen. bonuses and hinders comes towards the object and the player should move accordingly
Requirements are that the object can be moved up or down, the bonuses/hinders should react to hitting the car accordingly, the things should
approach smoothly

Solution 
we are going to use the functions (funtions for graphic) from labbworks in the beganning so the objects are going to be normal fonts. 
in th beganning it will bi some how a string "car" which sholud move a cross the y-axis to the left side of screen. 
it sholde be controlled by pish bottons. It shuold save itself from charachter say O and try to cach character L which will give extra live.
tje number of lives will be shown by leds.
The game will have different levels each 15 seconds. it means that the velocity of characters O and L which are moving towards string car
will increase( decrease delay) every 15 seconds.
when we are done with this and still have time, we are going to programme the graphics as well so that our project comes to an advance level.
because than we should use pixel by pixel movement.



We might use if statements depending on what should happen

Verification 

We will test by seeing that the requirements are met

Contributions

We should divide the 2 group members into different functions which we are responsible to write but we should report the things we do

Reflections

Will be an interesting project
